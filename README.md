# Info Frontend

This application exposes the user needs and metrics about content on GOV.UK.

It fetches content details (including user needs) from the [`content-store`](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store).

It renders URL paths prefixed with `info/`, for example: https://www.gov.uk/info/benefits-calculators and https://www.gov.uk/info/employers-sick-pay
